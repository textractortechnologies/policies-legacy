# IDS Policy

In order to preserve the integrity of data that Textractor stores, processes, or transmits for Customers, Textractor implements strong intrusion detection tools and policies to proactively track and retroactively investigate unauthorized access. Textractor currently utilizes [OSSEC](http://www.ossec.net/) to track file system integrity, monitor log data, and detect rootkit access.

## Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule

* 164.312(b) - Audit Controls

## Intrusion Detection Policy

* OSSEC is used to monitor and correlate log data from different systems on an ongoing basis. Reports generated by OSSEC are reviewed by the Security Officer on a monthly basis.
* OSSEC generates alerts to analyze and investigate suspicious activity or suspected violations.
* OSSEC monitors file system integrity and sends real time alerts when suspicious changes are made to the file system.
* Automatic monitoring is done to identify patterns that might signify the lack of availability of certain services and systems (DOS attacks).
* Static IP addresses are used for Textractor servers.
